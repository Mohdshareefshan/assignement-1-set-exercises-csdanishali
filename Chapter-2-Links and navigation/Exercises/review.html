    <h3>Minnal Murali review : Enjoyable Superhero Drama. <br>
    
        My rating : 3.25/5<br>
        Performances : 
        Tovino Thomas, who plays Jaison aka Minnal Murali brings the much-needed innocence to the character. But at the same time, he pulls off the superhero part with much ease. The actor once again proves his expertise in handling situational humour and scores with his balanced performance.
        However, it is the antagonist Guru Somasundaram who steals the show with his brilliant performance as Shibu. The actor displays the various mental states of his character convincingly, and even prompts the viewers to empathize with him at parts. Guru's performance in Minnal Murali is one of the finest we have seen in Malayalam cinema in recent times.
        The rest of the star cast, including Master Vasisht Umesh, Harisree Ashokan, Femina George, Aju Varghese, Baiju Santhosh, P Balachandran, Mammukkoya, Shelly Kishore, Rajesh Madhavan, and others are perfect in their respective roles.</h3>

    <h3> My Rating 4/5<br>

        Never kept any suppositions on this movie comparing it to super hero movies of the west.
        Basil joseph perfectly portrayed Minnal Murali as a Circumscribed Super hero Who rescues his fellow villagers From the clutches of the villian..
        The Thing that amused and startled me the most was the performance of Villian.
        Tremendous performance from Guru SomasundaramðŸ‘Œ 
        His character was awfully dreadful in later part of the movie and the way he portryaed it becomes one of the best part of the Movie.
        I have no words to describe his performance.He scored in almost all the scenes and sometimes we feel that his Role is Greater than that of the protagonist. Now i have no wonders why Tovino wanted the role of villianðŸ˜‚.
        
                 And Now coming to the performance of Tovino, he perfectly portrayed all the emotions and some of the burlesque scenes along with a role of a pantomime hero. This Character is truly a feather in the cap for Tovino's Career. Some of the emotional scenes were depicted by him in such a precise way that it really took the viewers along with the flow.
        Last but not the least the boy who comes as Tovino's Nephew was another salient character who could not be missed out.
        
        The characters portrayed by Aju varghese (Pothan),Sajan (Baiju) and Harisree Ashokan (Dasan) Made minnal Murali a perfect emotional, comical and Entertaining Super hero Thriller to watch.
                            I have no words to thank Basil joseph for taking such a risk and awarding Malayalam industry with such a remarkable Experimental super hero movie. TBH the movie never gave me a feeling that it was an experimental one infact it Grew up along with the limitations perfectly depicting hero of a confined Hamlet.</h3>
        
        Eagerly waiting for part 2ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
