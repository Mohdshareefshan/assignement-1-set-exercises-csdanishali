    <p><b>In the 1990s, Jaison, a young tailor from the village of Kurukkanmoola, dreams of building a career in the US, but his plans are hindered by obstacles in his personal life. SI Saajan opposes Jaison's relationship with his daughter Bincy, who is engaged to Aneesh. Aneesh's ex-girlfriend Bruce Lee Biji is also resentful towards him. Meanwhile, Shibu, a social outcast, harbors feelings for his childhood sweetheart Usha, who happens to be the sister of Daasan, a worker in Jaison's father Varkey's tailor shop. Despite Shibu's affection, Usha holds resentment towards him. Furthermore, Usha's daughter requires urgent medical treatment, but they lack the necessary funds.
        <br><br>
        On Christmas Eve, lightning strikes Jaison and Shibu simultaneously, granting them telekinetic superpowers. Jaison's nephew Josemon believes the lightning caused Jaison's newfound abilities. Shibu, using his superpower, intervenes when Usha is harassed at a teashop to earn her affection. Meanwhile, Jaison's plans to move to the U.S are dashed when Saajan reveals a family secret: Jaison is not Varkey's biological son, but rather the son of Martin, a deceased theater actor. Feeling betrayed, Jaison seeks revenge.
        <br><br>
        Disguised as Minnal Murali, a character from Martin's unfinished play, Jaison attacks Saajan and others at an event, leaving behind clues that point to his implication. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Jaison, Daasan has already covered the cost of Usha's daughter's surgery by stealing the money Jaison had saved for his visa application, which was kept in his tailor shop. Shibu, unaware of this development, robs a bank to raise funds. When Jaison discovers his missing savings, he confronts Daasan, filled with rage and sorrow. Later that day, in a fit of anger because Daasan opposed his alliance with Usha, Shibu burns down Jaison's store, resulting in Daasan's death, and frames Minnal Murali in the crime.

        Jaison confides in Biji about his alter ego, seeking help to clear his name. Together with Josemon, they attempt to prove Jaison's innocence. The police identify Shibu as the impostor, but he evades capture, leading to a showdown between him and Jaison. During their confrontation on a bus, the driver dies, and the bus hangs perilously over a cliff, which Jaison saves, earning the villagers' respect. As tensions escalate, Shibu's obsession with Usha culminates in tragedy when her house explodes, killing her and her daughter. Grief-stricken, Shibu seeks vengeance, terrorizing a church congregation and trapping Josemon and others. The police enlist Jaison's help, recognizing him as the only one capable of stopping Shibu.
        <br><br>
        Donning a supersuit, Jaison confronts Shibu at the church. Initially overpowered, Jaison taps into his inner strength, remembering his father's sacrifice, and defeats Shibu, ending his reign of terror. Despite the loss, Jaison earns the villagers' gratitude, while Biji extinguishes the flames. In a voiceover, Jaison pledges to protect the villagers from future threats as Minnal Murali.
